## Description
The "Super Market Sales Prediction" project is a machine learning-based application that predicts super market sales based on various features. This project demonstrates the use of multiple regression algorithms to make sales predictions.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/kathir79/super-market-sales-prediction.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd super-market-sales-prediction
    ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
2. Navigate to the `super_market_sales_prediction.ipynb` file and open it.
3. Run the cells in the notebook to load the data, preprocess it, train the models, and evaluate their performance.

## Models and Evaluation
The project utilizes the following regression models:
- **Linear Regression**: A simple linear approach to modeling the relationship between the dependent variable and one or more independent variables.
- **Decision Tree Regressor**: A non-linear model that splits the data into subsets based on feature values.
- **Random Forest Regressor**: An ensemble method that uses multiple decision trees to improve prediction accuracy.
- **Gradient Boosting Regressor**: An ensemble technique that builds models sequentially, each one correcting the errors of its predecessor.

Model performance is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
