Description
The ‚ÄúSuper Market Sales Prediction‚Äù project is a machine learning-based application that predicts super market sales based on various features. This project demonstrates the use of multiple regression algorithms to make sales predictions.

Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine:
##
<tab><tab>git clone https://github.com/kathir79/supermarket-sales-prediction.git

Navigate to the project directory:
cd supermarket-sales-prediction

Install the required dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage
Open the Jupyter Notebook:
jupyter notebook

Navigate to the super_market_sales_prediction.ipynb file and open it.
Run the cells in the notebook to load the data, preprocess it, train the models, and evaluate their performance.
Models and Evaluation
The project utilizes the following regression models:

Linear Regression: A simple linear approach to modeling the relationship between the dependent variable and one or more independent variables.
Decision Tree Regressor: A non-linear model that splits the data into subsets based on feature values.
Random Forest Regressor: An ensemble method that uses multiple decision trees to improve prediction accuracy.
Gradient Boosting Regressor: An ensemble technique that builds models sequentially, each one correcting the errors of its predecessor.
Model performance is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
